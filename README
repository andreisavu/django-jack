Jack - Beanstalkd web administration interface
==============================================

What is beanstalkd?
-------------------

"... a fast, general-purpose work queue."

See http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/ for general info.

What can I do using this application?
-------------------------------------

- put job on queue in a given tube
- inspect job: view body and statistics
- inspect burried jobs and kick all or individual
- inspect delayed jobs
- view what tubes are currently in use and stats
- view queue statistics

Requirements
------------

* Django 1.1

    http://www.djangoproject.com/

* beanstalkc

    http://github.com/earl/beanstalkc

Mods
----
Basically, the "handsome" in this name comes from the single line of code:
font-family: "Helvetica LT Std", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
in jack/beanstalk/templates/beanstalk/base.html
This changed the font from a serif font (Times New Roman I think on most systems) to a nice Helvetica font

The other adjustment is moving the the folder accounts
(./jack/templates/accounts)
to the beanstalk templates
(./jack/beanstalk/templates/accounts)
This prevented Django from whining that it couldn't find the correct templates to login with

Installation
------------
I spend ages getting this to work, and this little passage is what I learnt when I installed it
I will revise this once I move VPS's again and have to reinstall it

I managed to work out how to install django/beanstalkc by extracting it, "cd"ing into it and running:
python setup.py install

I did end up going on a goose hunt installing dependancies, simply put, google it
egg files are installed by going "sh *.egg"

Paraphrased from here:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/

python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
equates (roughly to)
rake db:migrate
thin start -a 0.0.0.0 -p 8000

Read the end of the stack trace, in my experiance it came up with an human-readable error

Sorry about the crud instructions, I'll update them when I swap VPS's and install beanstalkd
Good luck! :)
